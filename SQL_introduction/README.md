## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

### General
- What's a database
- What's a relational database
- What does SQL stand for
- What's MySQL
- How to create a database in MySQL
- What does `DDL` and `DML` stand for
- How to `CREATE` or `ALTER` a table
- How to `SELECT` data from a table
- How to `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` data
- What are `subqueries`
- How to use MySQL functions

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using `MySQL 8.0` (version 8.0.25)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
- All your files should start by a comment describing the task
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (`SELECT`, `WHERE`â€¦)
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## More Info

### Comments for your SQL file:
```sql
$ cat my_script.sql
-- 3 first students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
$
```

### Use the sandbox to run MySQL

#### For Ubuntu 22.04 (Current image on CoD Platform)
- Ask for a container `Ubuntu 22.04`
- Update package list
```bash
root@11240ca261c0413fb4bb893a37e90f3d-2377118072:~# apt update
```

- Install `mysql-server` package
```bash
root@11240ca261c0413fb4bb893a37e90f3d-2377118072:~# apt install -y mysql-server
```

- Check it was installed properly
```bash
root@11240ca261c0413fb4bb893a37e90f3d-2377118072:~# mysql --version
mysql  Ver 8.0.39-0ubuntu0.22.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))
```

- Start MySQL Server service:
```bash
root@11240ca261c0413fb4bb893a37e90f3d-2377118072:~# service mysql start
 * Starting MySQL database server mysqld                                                                                                                                 [ OK ]
```

- Check everything is ok by connecting to the server using the MySQL CLI via Linux Socket
```bash
root@11240ca261c0413fb4bb893a37e90f3d-2377118072:~# mysql -uroot
