# 📚 <u>Background Context</u>

In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

# 🎯 <u>Learning Objectives</u>
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## 📌 <u>General</u>
- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table

## 📋 <u>Requirements General</u>
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 2.0.x
Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
You are not allowed to use execute with sqlalchemy

### 🐬 <u>Install MySQL 8.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</u>

``` 
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
...
$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))
$ 
```

### 🔌 <u>Connect to your MySQL server:</u>

``` 
$ sudo mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 11
Server version: 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 (Ubuntu)

```

### 📦 <u>Install MySQLdb module version 2.0.x</u>

For installing MySQLdb, you need to have MySQL installed.

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
$ sudo pip3 install mysqlclient==2.0.3
...
$ python3
>>> import MySQLdb
>>> MySQLdb.version_info 
(2, 0, 3, 'final', 0)
Install SQLAlchemy module version 1.4.x
$ sudo pip3 install SQLAlchemy==1.4.22
...
$ python3
>>> import sqlalchemy
>>> sqlalchemy.__version__ 
'1.4.22'
```

Also, you can have this warning message:

```
/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/default.py:552: Warning: (1681, "'@@SESSION.GTID_EXECUTED' is deprecated and will be removed in a future release")                                                                                                                    
  cursor.execute(statement, parameters)
```
