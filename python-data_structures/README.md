# 🐍 Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## 📚 Project Description
This project focuses on Python's fundamental data structures: **lists** and **tuples**. Through a series of exercises, you will learn how to create, manipulate, and use these sequences effectively. The goal is to build a solid understanding of their differences, similarities, and best-use cases, as well as essential operations like slicing, list comprehensions, and sequence unpacking.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- 📝 What are lists and how to use them.
- 🔄 The differences and similarities between strings and lists.
- 🛠️ The most common methods of lists and how to use them.
- 📦 How to use lists as stacks and queues.
- 🧮 What are list comprehensions and how to use them.
- 📚 What are tuples and how to use them.
- 🤔 When to use tuples versus lists.
- 🧵 What is a sequence.
- 🎁 What is tuple packing.
- 📤 What is sequence unpacking.
- 🗑️ What is the `del` statement and how to use it.
