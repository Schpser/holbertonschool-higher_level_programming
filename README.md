# üêç Python Basics: Print & Strings Mastery

## üìò Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you will confidently explain these concepts without Google's help:

- **Using Python's interpreter effectively:** Master the command-line interface for quick testing and execution.
- **Printing text and variables:** Become proficient with the `print()` function.
- **String manipulation:** Learn essential techniques for working with strings, including concatenation and formatting.
- **Indexing and slicing:** Navigate and extract parts of strings with precision.
- **PEP 8 style guide and pycodestyle:** Write clean, readable code that adheres to industry standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

- **Python Scripts:** Use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as your editor.
- **Environment:** Developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with *Python 3.8.\*\*.
- **File Format:** All files must end with a newline character.
- **Shebang:** Each Python script must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Documentation:** Your repository must include a `README.md` (this file) and a mandatory `README.md` in the project directory.
- **Code Quality:** All scripts must be compliant with `pycodestyle` (v2.7.\*) and be executable. The length of each file should be verified using `wc`.
