# üêç Python: If/Else, Loops, and Functions

Welcome to a series of exercises designed to build a solid foundation in Python programming. This project focuses on core concepts like control flow, loops, and functions.

---

## üéØ Goals & Learning Objectives

- **Master Control Flow:**  
    Understand and effectively use `if`, `if...else`, `for`, and `while` statements.

- **Define Functions:**  
    Learn how to create and use functions, including the `return` statement.

- **Understand Key Concepts:**  
    Grasp the importance of indentation, variable scope, and how to debug with tracebacks.

- **Work with Data:**  
    Practice using arithmetic operators and formatted string output.

## üíª Project Details

| Detail        | Description                                                      |
|-------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version**   | All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.x |
| **Code Style**| All code must conform to the `pycodestyle` standard (v2.7.x)     |
| **Execution** | Files must be executable.<br>To make a file executable, run:<br>`chmod u+x <filename>` |

## üìÇ Tasks

Below is an array of tasks to complete for this project:

```python
tasks = [
        "Positive anything is better than negative nothing",
        "The last digit",
        "I sometimes suffer from insomnia...",
        "When I was having that alphabet soup...",
        "Hexadecimal printing",
        "00...99",
        "Inventing is a combination of brains...",
        "islower",
        "To uppercase",
        "There are only 3 colors...",
        "a + b",
        "a ^ b",
        "Fizz Buzz"
]
```

Or, view them as a checklist:

- [ ] Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- [ ] The last digit
- [ ] I sometimes suffer from insomnia...
- [ ] When I was having that alphabet soup...
- [ ] Hexadecimal printing
- [ ] 00...99
- [ ] Inventing is a combination of brains...
- [ ] islower
- [ ] To uppercase
- [ ] There are only 3 colors...
- [ ] a + b
- [ ] a ^ b
- [ ] Fizz Buzz
